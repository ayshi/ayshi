                    In a studio focused on visualizing, creating,and representing space, the final project was to design a wedding pavilion and site by Lake Erie. 
                    Starting with three planes before progressing to the cube and then the site, emphasis was placed on creating spacial relationships between the pavilion and its surroundings. By creating these relationships, spaces could be created that fulfiil the various requirements of the program. 
                    My design focuses on linear spaces used to direct both the flow of guests through the space as well as the attention of the guests
